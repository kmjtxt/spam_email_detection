# spam_email_detection

## Problem Statement
Mainly, the telecommunications industry can benefit from this solution, as SMS spam messages have been a long ongoing problem. With a strong model to predict and hence filter spam messages, customer experience and satisfaction can be enhanced as this adds a layer of protection against potential scam attempts. Additionally, the banking industry would also greatly benefit from such a solution, reducing financial loss to phishing attempts done via SMS. This is especially so as all parties – scam victims, telcos and banks – bear the consequences of in some way.  
 

## Dataset
We have selected a SMS Spam Collection dataset, which contains a total of 5574 text messages, labelled ham (real) or spam (fraudulent). The dataset is a combination of data from UK forum Grumbletext, NUS SMS Corpus, data collected by Dr Caroline Tagg for her PhD thesis, and the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big by José María Gómez Hidalgo.
